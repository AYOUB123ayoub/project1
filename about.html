    <h1>Who we are ? & what is our plan for u ?</h1></header>
<p>GoMyCode was founded in 2017 on the premises of our passion for digital technology and the realization that the gap between the </br> classical training offered and the job offers available needed to be bridged.
</br> We have built a real digital community and we are proud to be pioneers in Africa in this area. </br>
    We opened our doors in Algeria in 2020 with the vision of expanding the GoMyCode community and sharing our passion for digital with the entire MENA region.</p></br>
<p>
    In 4 months, you will learn Front-end and Back-end web development to become a junior developer in Fullstack JS. </br> You will also acquire soft skills that will help you in your professional life.
